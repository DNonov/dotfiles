# This script is the browsing/editing system of my personal wiki.
# I use Vim as an editor and fzf as a browser.
#
# Every file in the wiki has to contain at least one tag. If there are more
# tags they must be on same line and separated with white space. If a tag has
# more than one word has to be hayphenated e.g. (more-than-one-word).
#
# Tags example:
#   [comment]: #(maths programming functional-programming)
#
# These tags are used to feature all topics related with the file content. If
# a file contain one or more tags they will be displayed next to the file name
# in order to make the wiki searchable by tags via fzf. Tags are in form of
# markdown comments, the syntax of which was carefully chosen to be supported
# by the majority of markdown parsers.

# A bit of stackoverflow:

#
# N.B.: I use vi instead of vim in the script, since I've got zsh alias "vi"
# that point to nvim. Feel free to change it to any editor of choice.

set -e

# Get all markdown files in my index directory.
find ~/vimwiki -iname '*.md' |
  # Get all tags from each file.
  xargs grep -E "\[comment\]\:"|
  # Display only file name and tags in fzf list.
  cut -d ':' -f '1,3' |
  # If you press enter the selected file will be open in vim.
  fzf --bind "enter:execute: (echo {} | cut -d ':' -f'1' | xargs vi)"
